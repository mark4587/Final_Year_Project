The goal of this project is to build a tool that will monitor trusted sources of cybersecurity incident reports. When a new report is identified, extract information related to ‘key’ features related to cybersecurity incidents. Generate a classification scheme based on MITRE ATT&CK’s tactics and techniques matrix. Create a ‘threat profile’ by determining which tactics and techniques are reported in the cybersecurity incident. Organisations can create MITRE ATT&CK layers to reflect threats they anticipate and the degree to which they are protected from those threats. Use the organisation’s layer and the threat profile generated for the report to determine whether the organisation’s risk of attack is increased and should take steps to increase monitoring levels. Recommend mitigations if the risk level is increased.
